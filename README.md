# No-Catch-Up-Delay

**No Catch-Up** is an advanced feature that ensures that every movement of the stylus is immediately and fully reflected on the screen, without any delay. As soon as a gesture is detected, the system instantly transmits position information, without waiting for the cursor to ‘catch up’ with any offset. This approach offers perfect synchronisation between the physical movement of the stylus and its digital rendering, enabling almost instantaneous responsiveness.

For the user, this translates into exceptional fluidity: every micro-movement, every nuance of movement and every variation in the pressure exerted on the stylus is captured and displayed in real time. The result is a remarkable precision that makes the digital interface a true extension of the artist, enabling uncompromising creative expression.

By integrating No Catch-Up, the drawing or graphic retouching experience is optimised to the maximum, because the minimal delay between the physical action and its digital display ensures that the user's gesture is reproduced exactly as he or she imagined it. This makes for an extremely intuitive and responsive working environment, ideal for professionals, gamers and enthusiasts looking for perfection in every stroke.
